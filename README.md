# MS_Flow_Automate
Console-based tool to operate through Microsoft Flow approvals in my Team's project (Docs Digitization). Libraries used:
 - Selenium to operate on chromedriver and navigate through the website
 - keyboard to send/read input from the operator
 - PyAutoGui for making screenshots and looking for image on selected region
 - PyPerclip to work with Microsoft Clipboard
